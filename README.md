### About me
I graduated from Brunel University London in 2020 with a MSc in international business and BI. Then covid happend and found myself even more intersted in coding then i previously was. Later in the year i completed my Java SDET Consultant training at Sparta Global. Currently, I am working with my first client as a Java SDET consultant

I started self-teaching programming in the summer of 2020 soon after my graduation and have developed a whole host of skills since. Please see my "Skills" section below to know more about some of the things I've learnt during this time!
